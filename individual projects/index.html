      <div class="w3-left-align w3-padding-large">
        <p>    Ever since I was a child I was very imaginative. I would sit there in class and just imagine away, which honestly makes me believe there was some bribing going on behind the scenes to help me pass my classes (for legal reasons, this is a joke). Due to my artistic take on reality and life as we know it, I would always make some sort of art our of anything I was given; a paper crane our of my math assignment, paint my uniform, smear henna in an attempt to make a design on an arm (I was a chaotic child)</p>
        <p>So, plase click on "My Work" or scroll to the bottom of the page to read and see my art journey</p>
