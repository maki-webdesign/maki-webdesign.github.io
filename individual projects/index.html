        <p>Ever since I was a child I was very imaginative. I would sit there in class and just imagine away, which honestly makes me believe there was some bribing going on behind the scenes to help me pass my classes (for legal reasons, this is a joke). Due to my artistic take on reality and life as we know it, I would always make some sort of art our of anything I was given; a paper crane our of my math assignment, paint my uniform, smear henna in an attempt to make a design on an arm (I was a chaotic child) For a while now I was studing to work in the mdeical field and would constantly tell myself "Hey, quit doodling and finish your research paper" so I never really gave myself the opportunity to really put some time into my drawing skills. After switching my intended major I have given myself some time to discover different art styles platforms to see where I fit in.</p>
        <p> Animating logos and sketching portraits turned out to be my niche, so, plase click on "My Work" or scroll to the bottom of the page to read and see my art.</p>
