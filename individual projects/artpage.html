        <p><b>2012</b></p>
        <p>I made this drawing in 2012 (I was 10) which is when I first came to the U.S. I really liked painting and anything associated with using colored pencils and crayons. At this point I was copying almost everything my art teacher was doing, I even followed her into an art competition and won (surprising because my art was really underdeveloped).My teacher, Ms. Caty (the one who taught me how to draw these trees), was one of my mentors who had a huge impact on my art career. Knowing that there was someone there at such a young age that supported me really helped in my upbringing as an artist.</p>

        <p><b>2014</b></p>
        <p>I finally got to attend an art club after school and met a guy that taught me proportions between head, waist, knees, and feet. It was a true experience to have him teach me even though  my art wasn't as developed back then compared to now.</p>

        <p><b>2015</b></p>
        <p>A year later I was beginning to feel a bit more comfortable with using the tools that were given to us in the art club. I was staying later after school to get some pointers and tips from my teacher so I can draw more like him (he was my role model at the time).</p>

        <p><b>2019</b></p>
        <p>2019 was the year I started focusing on facial features. I started drawing the different shapes of eyes and lips and noses. I had given myself the task of watching tutorials and following art accounts on instagram so i can have more insight. This is also the year where I started to think that Biology wasn't the right track for me and started to shift my focus towards art and design majors such as graphic and UX design.</p>

        <p><b>2019</b></p>
        <p>At this point in my art journey I had gotten an ipad and pen. It took me a while to get used to using it since I was always using pencil and paper prior to getting the ipad. But once I practiced a bit I started using reference photos to draw people. I'm still not quite good at drawing clothes and certain positions during this time, but it is a big difference compared to my art from when I first arrived.</p>

        <p>(you might have to zoom in to see the details)</p>
        <p>And finally we have my most recent art (which I drew yesterday). At this point I was on tik tok and instagram enough to know the fundamentals of shading and applying the principles of angles. I would like to consider myself self taught since I discovered these different leassons and tips on my own and intergrated them into my own style. I'm still learning and can't wait to see how much my skills can develop in just a couple of years.</p>
