    <h3>Watch Dog VS Guard Dog</h3>
    <p style="color:#FF1493; font-size:x-large;">Did you know there is a difference between a watch dog and a guard dog?

      Although there are many dogs that can perform both duties of being a guard and watch dog, some breeds are
      specifically bred to “watch” or “guard”.</p>

    <h2>Watch Dog</h2>
    <p style="color:#FF1493; font-size:x-large;">A watchdog is one that will use its bark to alert you that a stranger is near your property or approaching your
      front door.

      Terriers, are great examples! They are one of a few good family watch dog breeds that barks loudly to alert their owners that a stranger is coming. They are also generally smaller in stature, and have to depend on their owner or a guard dog) to defend its territory.</p>

      <h2>Guard Dog</h2>
    <p style="color:#FF1493; font-size:x-large;"> A guard dog acts to serve to protect the home and family as well as surrounding areas. A guard dog’s bark is quite the opposite from a watch dogs bark. When a guard dog barks, it means more than a alert, it is a warning that an attack may take place. 

      The best guard dog breeds are generally intimidating in appearance with larger, more muscular bodies, large teeth, and a fearless intensity that easily scares off even the most brazen criminals. Another important guard dog trait is its willingness to bite anyone who is threatening its territory or its humans </p>
